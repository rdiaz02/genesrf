do not hard-wire the URL, but use as parameter or constant!!!

Full pdf report:
----------------

Creat a basic latex squeleton (names of figures and most filling text
are same).

Then get:
a) names of files in original directory; but can I?? If I can't, argue
confidentiality. 

b) version (R) and versions of key packages (random forest,
varSelRF, etc).

c) Settings for the run.

d) date (from LaTeX itself)

Then something like:

"Automatically generated report for GeneSrF (Gene Selection using
random Forests).

You run GeneSrF (http://...) on  date(). 

Then the figures (which are just includes common for all, since names
dont change; ojo, but whatch out for variable number of figures).

Then the rest.


An option is to prepare a bunch of pieces, then use cat and send all
to a single .tex file, and then pdftex it.

Buuuut: I don't like the cut and other uses of the shell for
security. Alternatively, could use R itself and then write or sink to
a file. (But pdftexit from Python). 

Or could use multiple latex files.
